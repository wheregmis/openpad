## 2025-05-22 – Caching Computed Display Values in Makepad PortalList
**Learning:** In Makepad widgets like `PortalList`, the `draw_walk` function is called every time an item needs to be rendered, which can be every frame during animations (like "Thinking" indicators). Performing string allocations, joins, or complex detection (like `text.contains("```")`) inside this loop causes significant heap churn and performance degradation as the list grows.
**Action:** Memoize all computed display strings and flags (markdown detection, activity summaries, formatted timestamps) into the underlying data structures (e.g., `DisplayMessage`) when they are created or updated. Accessing precomputed fields in the render loop is significantly faster and reduces allocations by nearly 100% per frame.
